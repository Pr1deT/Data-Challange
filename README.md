# Data-Challange
All code to train and evaluate the classification and segmentation models are documented in the notebook *walmart_datachal.ipynb*.
## 1. To train models and run evaluations:
- Run the cells in the first section 1. Data Preprocessing
### For income classification
- Run the cells in the second section 2. Income Classification
### For segmentation:
- Run the cells in the thrid section 3. Segmentation Model

## 2. To test trained models:
### For classification, run the cells in section 2.7 Testing
- Requires *rf_final.model* under the same directory
- Requires *rf_final.features* under the same directory
### For clustering, run the cells in section 3.6 Test New Samples
- Requires *kmeans_final.model* under the same directory
- Requires *kmeans_final.features* under the same directory
